        <h2 id="intro">Overview of GST 101</h2>
        <h2 id="introTopic">Welcome to GST 101: Use of English and Communication Skills I.</h2>
        <p id="introContent">As you begin your university journey, this course serves as a vital foundation for your academic success and beyond. In Nigerian tertiary institutions, GST 101 is a mandatory General Studies course designed for all first-year students, regardless of your discipline—whether you are studying Engineering, Medicine, Arts, Sciences, or any other field. English is the primary language of instruction, research, and assessment in our universities, and effective command of it is essential for understanding lectures, reading textbooks, writing assignments, participating in discussions, and excelling in examinations.
        Many students transition from secondary school facing challenges with the higher demands of university-level communication: comprehending complex texts, taking accurate notes during fast-paced lectures, expressing ideas clearly in writing, and listening critically. GST 101 addresses these gaps directly by equipping you with practical skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing.
        What You Will Learn in This Course
        This manual will guide you through key areas of effective communication and study techniques, including:
        Listening and note-taking skills for lectures and discussions.
        Reading comprehension strategies (skimming, scanning, and critical reading).
        Vocabulary development and register awareness.
        Basic grammar, sentence structure, and paragraphing.
        Introduction to academic writing and information retrieval.
        By the end of this course, you will be better prepared not only to succeed in your studies but also to communicate confidently in professional and everyday settings. These are lifelong skills that will empower you in a knowledge-driven world.
        We encourage you to engage actively with the materials—complete the exercises, participate in tutorials (where applicable), and apply what you learn daily. Your effort here will pay dividends throughout your university experience and career.
        Let's embark on this rewarding journey together!</p>

        <h1 id="">3.1 What is Listening?</h1>
<p id="">Listening is the conscious, active process of receiving, interpreting, and responding to spoken messages. It goes beyond mere hearing, which is a passive physiological act of detecting sound waves through the ears. True listening involves mental engagement: focusing attention, decoding meaning, evaluating content, and often preparing an appropriate response.
In the context of university education, listening is a core academic skill. Lectures, tutorials, seminars, and group discussions are primarily oral, making listening the primary channel through which you acquire new knowledge. Effective listening enables you to:
Grasp complex ideas and theories presented by lecturers.
Identify relationships between concepts.
Recognise emphasis on important points.
Understand instructions for assignments and examinations.
Poor listening results in fragmented understanding, while strong listening leads to deeper comprehension, better retention, and higher academic performance. As a student, developing excellent listening ability is one of the most valuable investments you can make in your education.</p>

        <h1 id="">3.2 Why Must We Listen?</h1>
<p id="">Listening is the foundation of all learning and communication. Here are some compelling reasons why developing strong listening skills is non-negotiable for university students:
Academic Success Depends on It
Most information in university is delivered orally—through lectures, guest talks, and class discussions. If you cannot listen effectively, you will miss critical concepts, instructions for assignments, exam hints, and references to recommended readings.
Accurate Note-Taking Relies on Good Listening
You cannot take useful notes if you do not first identify main ideas, supporting details, examples, and transitions in the speaker’s delivery. Poor listening leads to incomplete or inaccurate notes, which in turn affects revision and performance.
Critical Thinking and Analysis Are Built on Listening
To evaluate arguments, spot biases, or ask intelligent questions, you must first listen carefully to what is being said (and sometimes what is left unsaid).
Professional and Social Competence
Employers consistently rank “active listening” among the top skills they seek in graduates. In interviews, meetings, teamwork, and leadership roles, the ability to listen attentively sets you apart.
Avoiding Misunderstandings
Many conflicts, failed group projects, and low marks on assignments arise from misheard instructions or misunderstood expectations. Good listening prevents costly errors.
Personal Growth and Empathy
Listening helps you understand diverse perspectives, cultures, and experiences—essential in a multicultural university setting and in life beyond campus.
In short, listening is not a passive activity; it is an active skill that directly influences your grades, relationships, and future career.</p>

        <h1 id="">3.3 Listening Enabling Skills</h1>
<p id="">To become an effective listener, you need to develop and practise specific enabling skills. These include:
Concentration and Focus
Train your mind to stay present. Minimize distractions by choosing a good seat in class, switching off notifications, and mentally preparing to engage with the topic.
Non-Verbal Attentiveness
Show the speaker you are listening through eye contact, nodding, appropriate facial expressions, and an open posture. Avoid fidgeting, looking at your phone, or appearing disinterested.
Avoiding Premature Judgement
Suspend evaluation until the speaker has finished. Do not interrupt or mentally argue while the person is still speaking.
Identifying Main Ideas and Supporting Details
Listen for signal words and phrases such as “firstly,” “in addition,” “however,” “most importantly,” “in conclusion,” which help you recognise structure and hierarchy of ideas.
Asking Clarifying Questions
When appropriate (e.g., during Q&A sessions or tutorials), ask questions to confirm understanding: “Could you please explain…?” or “Do you mean that…?”
Paraphrasing and Summarising Mentally
Internally rephrase what you hear in your own words. This reinforces comprehension and retention.
Empathetic Listening
Try to understand the speaker’s feelings and viewpoint, even if you disagree. This builds rapport and deeper insight.
Listening for Context and Tone
Pay attention to the speaker’s tone of voice, emphasis, pauses, and emotion—these often convey meaning beyond the words themselves.
By consciously practising these enabling skills, you will transform from a passive hearer into an active, purposeful listener capable of maximising every learning opportunity.</p>
